Hello there, amazing people of our cohort! 👋

I'm Toni, and I'm super excited to introduce you to "Bao Memory." Think of it as our shared diary, a cozy digital space where we can store all the sweet, funny, and unforgettable memories we've made together. From our first hello to our late-night coding adventures, every moment has been a part of this incredible journey.

## Dive into Bao Memory 📖

Bao Memory is built with some cool and robust technologies - Django, PostgreSQL, Python, Docker, and CSS. It's not just a memory bank; it's a testament to our growth as developers and friends.

### Features at Your Fingertips:

- **Create a Memory:** Share your favorite moments with the cohort.
- **Read and Relive:** Stroll down memory lane anytime you want.
- **Update the Memories:** Add more details or new perspectives to our shared stories.
- **Delete (if you must):** We hope every memory stays, but you have the control.
